<h1>A System for Managing Appointments in a Clinic</h1>

<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project introduces a computerized system for managing appointments between patients and doctors in clinics, specifically those which deal with continuous treatments like psychology or physical therapy.</p>

<h2>2. Background</h2>
<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Many small medical centers still rely on outdated manual tools, such as physical diaries, leading to inefficiencies and disorganization.</p>
<p><strong>Client Profile:</strong> Clinics involved in ongoing treatments where both doctors and patients need a streamlined appointment system.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives:</strong> Facilitate efficient queue management and appointment scheduling. Enhance the patient experience by providing a more organized and time-effective appointment system.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong> An unorganized appointment system often results in long wait times and confusion among staff. With this project, the aim is to bring about order, efficiency, and convenience for all parties involved.</p>

<h2>3. Market Analysis</h2>
<p>A notable portion of the medical sector still uses manual processes for appointment setting. This leads to patients enduring extended wait times and general disorganization in clinics. Our solution caters especially to those undergoing intensive treatments like physical therapy, orthopedic, or psychological services.</p>

<h2>4. Innovations & Improvements</h2>
<ul>
